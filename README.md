"Chi Mai" will be a text-based puzzle/adventure game, kind of like Java's World of Zuul, but made in Python. Actually, I'd say it's a bit more like Zork, or if I'm lucky, like Myst. 

The core of the game's code is the parser I'm building from scratch, for which I currently have a makeshift prototype. However, It ought to be a recursive descent parser based around a simple command-based grammar before I'm done.
